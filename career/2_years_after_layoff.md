# Two Years After Layoff
## written by [juJP77 on Blind](https://us.teamblind.com/s/ZdqMUpH7)

I wanted to share my perspective to the folks that are being affected with the recent flight of layoffs happening. I am two years into my previous layoff when covid hit first and I hope I can share my experience so that people going through the same can relate and feel better.

First about me, I worked at Uber for almost 5 years and went through all the turmoil back then. Through the end of my tenure there me and my wife wanted to have our first child. I didn't take my parental leave due to some deliverables for the year, worked 12 hours every day to get that done and took care of my son at night for months. Once the project was stable and we had a clear roadmap I decided I will take my parental leave of four months to spend my time with my newborn, who wasn't really a newborn then but still I wanted to chip in and help.

First month of my leave the news of layoff emerged. I wasn't following what was going on but given that I had great ratings for the past year I thought I was going to be safe. I received the call strolling my son in a park one morning from HR that I was getting cut and similar communications you are receiving probably right now.

I felt devastated and worthless. I thought we turned the corner and I had more to give but I wasn't needed. I remember I was looking at my son in the stroller after the call and things didn't make any sense. He was smiling at me, and I had this profound feeling that I failed him. I was a failure. I was angry, confused and didn't know what was going to happen next.

Back then I identified with who I was at work, a successful engineer who was doing great things that was going to make a difference. I didn't understand how this could have gone wrong, all the memories and the plans were just wiped by a phone call.

I had some time to reflect after this happened and went through phases of anger, self doubt and uncertainty. I continued spending more time with my family, my friends and people who cared for me, who really didn't know what I was going through because most didn't know. I didn't tell them because I was ashamed.

The market wasn't great. Everything was on standby when covid hit, offices closed, interviews paused. I didn't know what to do next but I decided that I wanted to spend more time on the things that mattered. The things that made me happy.

I spent the next few months spending time with my family and thought about what would make me happy in my next phase in life, all the while thinking about what my family needed for a stable transition.

I stopped thinking about attachment, belonging and career. I started thinking about what I needed.

I realized that after all this time, this is nothing but a job. The companies you work for, you bled for and you sweat for, the companies you sacrifice your prime youth years for do not care about you. We are nothing but a number when it comes down to the bottomline. Companies do not work in ways to care about us, our livelihood and our future if things don't pan out. The messaging is usually different. "We will change the way people connect", "we will make transportation as easy as running water blah blah", "we will revolutionize the way something is done" are just punchlines that companies push to keep their employees engaged.

The only thing that matters is YOU. Your family, your friends, your life, your loved ones. You won't get another life to enjoy the things that you worked so hard for. Everything else is noise. These companies want you to believe there is more purpose. There isn't.

Here are the bullet points of the main lessons I have learned after two years following:

Optimize for your life. If it is money, siphon as much as you can from whatever your endeavor is.  If WLB, make sure you abuse it to the fullest extend.

Make sure you have a plan if things go bad. Make sure your savings are in order, brace for impact to cover for a while. If you are on a visa, think about what that means for you. There is a lot more life outside of US that can offer you a great life and opportunities. Honestly there are so many places I would rather live if it weren't for my kids.

Do not ignore the things that you care about for the sake of sacrificing for a project, deadline, whatever.

Elon "robber baron wannabe" doesn't care about you, neither does Mark Zuchy who is living his second puberty in his Hawaiian castle. They don't live the life that you do, and they will never understand what each of you go through.

For me now any job I take is about numbers. I look at my paycheck, figure out what I can do minimally to get the most leverage for what's next. I view my current job at Amazon the same. We'll go through layoffs as well. Whatever. I know my priorities and I wouldn't even think twice if I lose my job. For my next one, I wouldn't care about a 2-week notice, having that nice transition doc for my leave. Pay me more if you want me to work more after breakup, because you suck.

Things will turn around. You are talented people that can land and have a lot to offer. More importantly, a lot to live for. World isn't going to collapse to wipe us all out. If it does, we are right behind you. You are not alone. We are all in this together, today itâ€™s you, tomorrow it will be me. If you are laid off trying to keep things in perspective, go hug the people you love and enjoy life like you never did.

Things will be fine.
